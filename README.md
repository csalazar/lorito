# <ยบ\\\ lorito - HTTP security suite

# What's this about?

Please read the [introduction blog post](https://csal.medium.com/introducing-lorito-a-security-http-suite-153c6df05516).

# Architecture

lorito is a web app written in Elixir
that uses a postgres database to store its information.

# Running lorito

## Development

There's a [.devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) setup
to run Lorito for development purposes,
which includes both an app container and a PostgreSQL container.

If you load this repository in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
it will detect the devcontainer setup
and prompt you to open the project inside a Docker container.

Once inside the container, run `mix add_user` to create a user.

Then, execute `mix phx.server` to run lorito at `http://localhost:4000`
and its dashboard is available at `http://localhost:4000/_lorito`.

## Production

To create a production-ready package,
a `Dockerfile` is used to build an [Elixir release](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html#module-why-releases).

There are two prerequisites to run lorito:

- The postgres database must support SSL
- lorito must run over HTTPS because of the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API#security_considerations)

lorito needs two secrets (environment variables) to work:

- `DATABASE_URL`: postgres connection URI of your database
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: the secret key to sign cryptographic material such as session tokens

### Using docker-compose

You can use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run lorito.
To configure secrets, create a `.env` file to set:

* `DATABASE_URL`: `postgresql://` connection URI
* `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: you can generate one with `head -c 66 /dev/urandom | base64 -w 0`
* `PHX_HOST`: `localhost` by default, then you can modify it with a custom domain.

`docker-compose up` will run lorito at `http://localhost:4000`
and its dashboard at `http://localhost:4000/_lorito`.

To add a user, follow this steps:
1. Enter into the container with `docker-compose exec app /bin/bash`
2. Then, enter IEX with `./bin/lorito remote`
3. Add your user with `Lorito.Release.add_user("email@domain.tld")`

### Using docker-compose with a postgres container

If you want to take a look at lorito, you can use this setup.
Beware that it uses default distro SSL keys to set up SSL
and [containers aren't recommended for production databases](https://vsupalov.com/database-in-docker/).

You can execute `docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-db.yml up`
and then update `.env` with `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/app`.

# Deployment

## fly.io

My suggestion is to go with [fly.io](https://fly.io).
It takes care of secrets, SSL certificates, custom domains, monitoring, etc.

There's a little guide [here](docs/fly_io_deployment.md).
